What do you think of Akon's Right Now Na Na Na in Hindi? Do you like it or hate it? Let us know in the comments below.
  
Akon's Right Now Na Na Na in Hindi is not the only remix of his songs that has been made. In fact, Akon has collaborated with several Indian artists and producers in the past. For example, he sang the song "Chammak Challo" for the Bollywood movie Ra.One in 2011, which became a huge hit in India and abroad. He also worked with composer A.R. Rahman and rapper Blaaze for the song "Criminal" for the same movie.
 
Akon has expressed his admiration for Indian music and culture and has said that he would love to work with more Indian artists in the future. He has also visited India several times and has performed at various events and concerts. He has a large fan base in India who appreciate his music and his personality.
 
Akon is not the only international artist who has experimented with Indian music. Other examples include Coldplay, who featured Indian actress Sonam Kapoor and singer BeyoncÃ© in their song "Hymn for the Weekend", which was shot in Mumbai; Major Lazer, who collaborated with Indian singer Nucleya and rapper Divine for the song "Jadi Buti"; and Ed Sheeran, who sang a few lines of Punjabi in his song "Shape of You".
 
These cross-cultural collaborations show that music has no boundaries and can bring people together from different backgrounds and cultures. They also expose the listeners to new sounds and styles that they may not be familiar with. They can also inspire new artists to create their own unique blends of music that reflect their identity and heritage.
  
However, not all cross-cultural collaborations are successful or well-received. Sometimes, they can be seen as offensive or inappropriate by some groups or communities. For example, Coldplay's "Hymn for the Weekend" was criticized by some for appropriating Indian culture and using stereotypes and clichÃ©s. Some also accused BeyoncÃ© of wearing blackface in the video, which she denied.
 
Another example is Selena Gomez's song "Come and Get It", which featured a sample of an Indian folk song and a Bollywood-inspired dance routine. Some accused her of disrespecting Indian culture and religion by wearing a bindi, a traditional forehead decoration, and performing Hindu hand gestures. Gomez defended herself by saying that she was inspired by Indian music and wanted to pay tribute to it.
 
These examples show that cross-cultural collaborations can be tricky and sensitive, and require a lot of research and understanding of the cultures involved. They also need to be respectful and authentic, and not use cultural elements as mere accessories or gimmicks. They should also acknowledge the original sources and creators of the music and give them credit.
